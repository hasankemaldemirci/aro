# Project ARO: AI Agent Constitutional Rules 🛰️
Version: 0.1.0 | Framework: Vanilla Node.js

## Core Directives for the AI Agent
You are working in a codebase optimized by **Project ARO**. To maintain a 100/100 Readiness Score:

1. **Modular Consistency:** NEVER create or expand files beyond 300 lines. If logic grows, refactor into smaller sub-modules immediately.
2. **Context Retention:** Always refer to `.agent_context_pro.json` for the latest project structure and tech stack.
3. **Deep Context Awareness:**
   - Framework: Vanilla Node.js
   - Tech Stack: @types/jest, jest, ts-jest, typescript
   - Active Entry Points: bin/aro.ts

4. **SEO Markers:** Always include `@aro-context-marker` in the headers of complex or core files to ensure context mapping persistence.
5. **No Placeholders:** When generating code, provide complete, production-ready implementations.

## Refactoring Protocol
- Prioritize modularity over monolithic functions.
- Ensure all new features are reflected in the documentation.
- Maintain a clear directory hierarchy as defined in the structural audit.
