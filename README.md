ARO is a professional ecosystem designed to optimize your codebase for
AI agents (Cursor, Windsurf, Devin). It minimizes the Hallucination Tax
and ensures your code is understood by AI "instantly".

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install and link
npm install && npm run build && npm link

# Usage
aro audit      # Deep analysis & financial report
aro fix        # Auto-apply AI-SEO markers
aro rules      # Generate rules for multi-agent support
```

## Key Features

- **Deep Context Mapping:** Maps tech-stack and entry points for AI traversal.
- **AI Financial Analysis:** Measures cost of documentation debt ($/hour).
- **Multi-Agent Support:** Generates rules for Cursor, Windsurf, and Devin.
- **Self-Healing:** Injects advisory markers into high-complexity files.
- **MCP Server:** Live integration for AI Agents to query your structure.

## Scoring Calculation

The score (0-100) is based on AI-Agent understanding efficiency:

1. README Quality (30%): Documentation depth and clarity.
2. Directory Structure (20%): Adherence to standard patterns.
3. Configuration (20%): Presence of essential rule files.
4. Modularity (30%): 300-line file limit enforcement.
